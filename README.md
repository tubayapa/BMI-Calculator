📊 BMI Calculator 🌐 A responsive web application to calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) and provide you with a health risk category based on your BMI score.

BMI is a person's body mass divided by the square of their body mass, typically expressed in kg/m². The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) uses a person's weight in pounds and height in inches to calculate their BMI.

🚀 In this calculator, we classify the risk categories based on the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Here's a summary of the categories:

Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: BMI 18.5 - 24.9
Overweight: BMI 25 - 29.9
Obese: BMI 30 and above

🛠️ Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

📣 Shoutout to World Health Organization for providing the BMI calculator.
